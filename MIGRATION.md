# Migration Plan: Transitioning to SOLID Architecture

## Phase 1: Parallel Implementation (Current)
- Create SOLID-compliant service classes
- Create new entry points (background_solid.js, popup_solid.js)
- Keep original implementation working

## Phase 2: Testing & Validation
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all new services
- Run mutation tests to ensure test quality
- Manually test the new implementation
- Fix any issues discovered

## Phase 3: Switchover
- Update manifest.json to use new implementation
- Create a feature flag system to easily switch between implementations
- Monitor for any issues

## Phase 4: Cleanup
- Remove old implementation files once new implementation is stable
- Update documentation
- Refactor any remaining technical debt

## Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Tests | Notes |

| ChromeBookmarkRepository | Complete | ✅ | |
| BookmarkTransactionManager | Complete | ✅ | |
| BookmarkOperationExecutor | Complete | ✅ | |
| BookmarkRestructuringService | Complete | ✅ | |
| DOMUIService | Complete | ❌ | Need tests |
| background_solid.js | Complete | ❌ | Need integration tests |
| popup_solid.js | Complete | ❌ | Need integration tests |

## Service Worker Limitations

Due to limitations in the Service Worker specification, dynamic imports (`import()`) are not allowed in background scripts. We've addressed this by:

1. Using static imports in background.js
2. Creating a minimal background_loader.js that sets up basic functionality
3. Deferring the implementation choice to popup.js when the user interacts with the extension

This approach allows us to maintain the feature flag system while working within the constraints of the Service Worker specification.
